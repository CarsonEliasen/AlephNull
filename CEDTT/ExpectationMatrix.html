          The expectation matrix is a way for you to efficiently reanalyze your assumptions that were held before going into data collection
        </p>

        <h2>
          Step by Step Instructions
        </h2>
      </center>
        <p>1. Write down all of your questions from data collection.</p><br>
        <p>2. For each question, write down what you expect the answer to be </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 35px; font-size: 85%;"><em>(Tip: If you have created personas already, try answering the questions for each of your personas!)</em></p><br>
        <p>3. Next prepare your matrix by putting your questions on the vertical axis and your interviewees on the horizontal axis</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 35px; font-size: 85%;"><em>Each cell in the matrix should correspond to an individual's answer to one question!</em></p><br>
        <p>4. For each cell, rate that answer on a scale of 1-10 on how much it aligned with your expected answer (1 being completelty off, 10 being spot on)</p><br>
        <p>5. Now take the average score for each question (i.e. from each row)</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35px; font-size: 85%;"><em>(Tip: You may have groups with widly different answers! If this happens, try taking two or more averages and asking why they differ)</em></p><br>
        <p>6. Discuss with anyone else on your team if your assumptions are valid</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 35px; font-size: 85%;">
            Some questions to consider:
            <ul style="font-size: 85%;">
              <li>Would your interviewees actually experience the problem you are trying to solve regularly?</li>
              <p style="text-indent: 35px; font-size: 100%;">If so, is the problem actually bothering them?</p>
              <li>What differed between how people actually experienced the problem and how you expected them to experience it?</li><br>
              <li>How severe did the problem seem to your interviewees? How severe did you think it was?</li><br>
              <li>Were your interviewees just telling you what you wanted to hear? Be honest...</li><br>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>7. Decide on the next steps for your project with your new assumptions!</p>
