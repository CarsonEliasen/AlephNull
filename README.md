# Welcome to Carson Eliasen's Design Thinking Tools!
Design thinking has been a passion of mine throughout my life, but I've found that it can be hard to be a "design thinker" for some people. Because of my dedication to education, I'd love to provide some assistance to those who need it. As this collection expands, I hope it will serve to propel your projects to the next level!

## Special Thanks
Thank you so much to the [Richardson Design Center](https://www.chhs.colostate.edu/rdc/) at Colorado State University for fostering and encouraging my design thinking nature. Specifially:<br>
Sarah Badding, Scott Shrake, and Mark Schreiber. <br>
All three of these people have been excellent mentors and friends to me since I've met them.
